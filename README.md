### Hi there 👋

**christian80gabi/christian80gabi** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a TODO list project (funny hein! Why am I borthering myself doing a so simple project? Because practicing and repetion are the fundamentals)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning *Spring Boot*
- 💬 Ask me about NOTHING 😁
- 📫 How to reach me: [twitter](https://www.twitter/christian80gabi)
